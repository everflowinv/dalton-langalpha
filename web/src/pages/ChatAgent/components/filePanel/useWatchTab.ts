 * The Status tab follows the market watch: it joins the strip as a watch
 * starts, without taking focus from the tab being read. Only that transition
 * acts. A panel mounted under a watch already running leaves the reader on
 * what they opened it for, and the chip in the chat is the way in; a stamp
 * that changes nothing about the watch never pulls the strip back to a tab
 * the reader closed. A watch ending leaves the tab where it is, showing that
 * nothing is watched: closing it would take a tab the reader may be looking
 * at, and a watch resumed a moment later would bring it back unfocused, as
 * though it were new.
